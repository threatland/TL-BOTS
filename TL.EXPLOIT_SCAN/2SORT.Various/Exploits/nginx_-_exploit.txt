Introduction:
 This exploit allows users to DDoS with a list of NGINX servers DDoS attacks scale at 200GB/s with a list of 2,000 NGINX servers. 10 million NGINX devices are currently being found via Shodan.io.
PoC/Proof of Concept:


Yes we all know what nginx is, We've seen it on a web-server before maybe even just browsing the web.
It is literally everywhere, The exploit consists of their handlers for scripts,
Their was exactly five i found that was interesting, 
One of them was one that would act as of ping-back exploits for DDoSing, 
but the one I'm showing you guys is one that was hitting at 200GB/s with 2,000 exploited nginx boxes, 
& it consists of using a a "PoD" aka "Ping of Death" i mentioned this in some of my other tweets, 
Now you're think, well do you have to look for older versions of Windows & Linux devices that can preform the "PoD." 
My response is, No, The exploit I've found is will use it's payload to run the "PoD" exploit, 
The "PoD" exploit i discovered will remain private due to misuse of it,
